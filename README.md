# Yahfaz LINE Bot

Yahfaz is a bot that supports you in memorizing the Quran using a spaced repetition system, helping you stay consistent even with a busy schedule.

## Main Features

### Learn

Use the Learn feature to log Quran pages you've memorized. Yahfaz accepts entries one page at a time.

### Review

Yahfaz will schedule reviews for you based on spaced repetition principles, reminding you when it's time to revisit a page. To see which pages are scheduled for review, use the Show command. When you're ready, use the Review command and assess your memorization for each page:

- Easy: 0-1 mistakes (review interval increases).
- Good: 2-3 mistakes.
- Hard: 4+ mistakes (review interval shortens).

With Yahfaz, you can keep track of your progress and review efficiently, ensuring long-term retention.
